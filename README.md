 **This is a second years data structure codes.**
**A data structure is a way of organizing and storing data in a computer's memory to efficiently perform operations on that data. It provides a logical representation of the data and defines how it can be accessed, modified, and manipulated. Data structures are fundamental components of computer programming and are used to solve various computational problems.**

**An algorithm, on the other hand, is a step-by-step procedure or a set of rules for solving a specific problem or accomplishing a particular task. Algorithms take inputs, perform a series of well-defined operations, and produce an output. They are designed to solve problems efficiently, using the available resources, such as time and memory.**
